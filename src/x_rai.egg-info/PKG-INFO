## Project descriptions
**XRAI (eXplanable Regression-based Artificial Intelligence)** is a package for the integration of regression-based machine-learning and eXplainable AI via the SHAP-package. XRAI allows the prediction of a target variable via several ML algorithms from scikit-learn (Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, XGBoost, and a Support Vector Regression meta-learner). Algorithm selection is conducted via nested cross-validation.

Specifications can be selected regarding the internal and external folds, the selected algorithms and the use of feature selection via featureWiz. The cross-validation scheme can be safed for reproductibility. SHAP allows the estimation of feature importance both for individual predictions, as well as across the whole dataset.
